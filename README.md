# BlockDelayTrap
The trap will react if too many blocks have passed between two consecutive selections (for example, > 50). This is useful if the operator wants to catch anomalies in the network (e.g., confirmation delays or suspicious pauses in activity). This information helps to see failures or manipulations at the network/RPC level.
